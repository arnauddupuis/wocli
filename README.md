# wocli

## Intro

A toolset to get an update World of Warcraft addons from Curse.com (main target is Linux but you never know, it can work on other OS).

The goal is to provide a command line tool as well as a nice UI.

So far it's a Perl script but things will change (or not). 

Please note it's work in progress. Feel free to help.

## Status

It is still under heavy development, nothing really works right now and it's more like a test of a workflow than the finale implementation.
However, I can promise one thing: this Perl script is going to work and do the job. So if I get tired of this or loose my purpose (stop playing WoW ^^). You still have a working tool.

## Help

Here is a basic help for this little program.

### Install

No need too, just run the script from the Github repo.
I'm using the following Perl modules that should be part of the Perl distribution on your Linux box:
* LWP::UserAgent
* Data::Dumper
* Getopt::Long
* File::Path
