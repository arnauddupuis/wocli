# wocli
A toolset to get an update World of Warcraft addons from Curse.com (main target is Linux but you never know, it can work on other OS).

The goal is to provide a command line tool as well as a nice UI.

So far it's a Perl script but things will change (or not). 

Please note it's work in progress. Feel free to help.
